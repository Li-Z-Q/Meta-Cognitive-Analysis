        "question": "How many ways are there to assign each of 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class if one of these six, Manoj, refuses to be in a class without any of his friends?",
        "answer": "62",
        "reference": "For each friend, there are 2 choices for which class to place them in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 6 friends, we multiply the number of choices together. Hence there are $2^6 = 64$ ways to split the friends into two classes. However, 2 of those 64 arrangements are invalid: we can't put Manoj in chemistry and everyone else in biology, and we can't put Manoj in biology and everyone else in chemistry. So our final answer is $64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",

        "answer": "10",
        "reference": "We can set up a proportion to find the ratio of wands to fands. $$\\frac{4 \\text{ wands}}{6 \\text{ rands}}\\times\\frac{24 \\text{ rands}}{8 \\text{ fands}}=\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{3 \\text{ rands}}\\times\\frac{3 \\text{ rands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}=\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}$$ Now we multiply the ratio of wands to fands by the number of fands.  $$\\frac{2 \\text{ wands}}{1 \\text{ fand}}\\times 5\\text{ fands}=10\\text{ wands}$$ The answer is $\\boxed{10}$ wands.",

        "question": "Amy, Ben, Carl, and Debbie each have some coins. Ben has three times the number of coins that Amy has and a third of the number of coins that Carl has, and Debbie has two-thirds the number of coins that Carl has. The number of coins that Amy has, multiplied by the number of coins that Ben has, multiplied by the number of coins that Carl has, multiplied by the number of coins that Debbie has, is $162$. How many coins do the four children have all together?",
        "answer": "19",
        "reference": "Let $a$ be the number of coins Amy has, $b$ the number Ben has, $c$ the number Carl has, and $d$ the number Debbie has. We can use the information in the problem to create the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b \\\\\n3b &= c \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}c &= d \\\\\na \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d &= 162\n\\end{align*} We know that $b = 3a$. Also, $c = 3b$, so $c$ must equal $9a$. Then, $d = \\frac{2}{3}c$, so $d = 6a$. Substituting these quantities into our product gives $a \\cdot 3a \\cdot 9a \\cdot 6a = 162,$ which simplifies to $162a^4 = 162,$ or $a^4 = 1,$ so $a = 1$. Given this value, we can find that $b = 3$, $c = 9$, and $d = 6$. Thus, the four children have $1 + 3 + 9 + 6 = \\boxed{19}$ coins all together.",
