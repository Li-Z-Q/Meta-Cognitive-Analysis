        "question": "Where would you keep a rug near your front door? Choose from: A. persia, B. desk, C. table, D. living room, E. hall",
        "answer": "D. living room",
        "reference": "A rug near the front door would typically be placed in an area that is adjacent to or near the entrance of the home to ensure cleanliness and add aesthetic appeal. The living room is a common area that is often close to the front door and where guests are frequently entertained. Therefore, placing a rug in the living room near the front door would be both functional and decorative. Other options such as Persia is a country and not a location within a house, a desk and table are furniture pieces not typically located near the front door, and the hall, while close to the entrance, is more of a passageway rather than a place to put a decorative rug. Thus, the most appropriate choice is the living room.",
