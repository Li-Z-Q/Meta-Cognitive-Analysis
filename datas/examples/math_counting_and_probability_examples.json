        "answer": "4",
        "reference": "The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \\boxed{4}$ such salads are possible.",
