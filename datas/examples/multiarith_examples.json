        "reasoning": "Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. First, she deleted 9 old songs, which means she now has 11 - 9 = 2 songs left on her mp3 player. Afterward, she added 8 new songs. To calculate the total number of songs on her mp3 player now, we add the number of songs she had left after deleting the old songs to the number of new songs she added: 2 + 8 = 10 songs. Therefore, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player after deleting the old ones and adding new ones. Therefore, the answer is 10.",
