        "answer": "54",
        "reference": "Each face of the cube has area $3\\cdot3=9$ square inches. Since the cube's surface area includes 6 faces, the total surface area is $9\\cdot6=\\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

        "answer": "8",
        "reference": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.",
